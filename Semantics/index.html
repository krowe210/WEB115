            <h2>Well, Do They?</h2>
            <p>Probably not, but it's very possible. There are many things that pharmacy customers do to irritate their pharmacists and technicians, sometimes without even realizing it.</p>

            <h2>Ways to ensure a smoother pharmacy experience:</h2>
            <li>Keep up with your insurance information. The pharmacy staff aren't psychic, they have no idea what your new insurance carrier is, and they definitely don't know your new ID#.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you have new insurance info, bring it in to have it updated before you need a refill. This will expedite your fill time when you actually need something.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If you are on your last refill, request that we contact your MD for more refills a few days before you run out, not on a Friday night ten minutes before you're supposed to take your next dose.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>If your doctor called/faxed/e-scribed your Rx, do not travel directly to the pharmacy from the doctor's office. Call ahead to see the soonest pickup time for your Rx.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Sign up for text/e-mail alerts! This is the fastest way to find out when your Rx is ready or if there are any issues with it. If you haven't received a notification and you think you should have, call your pharmacy.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>DO NOT yell at the pharmacy staff because of decisions made by your insurance. They decide your copays and whether medication is covered or not. Your pharmacy doesn't.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Most of what they do for their customers is done as a courtesy, it is not required. Calling your insurance, doctor's office, or sister's cousin's friend for information is technically your responsibility. It is fine to ask, but do not demand that they do these things. And if they do, be thankful. It is very time consuming.</li>

            <h2>What am I Doing Wrong?</h2>
            <p>Most pharmacy customers are just fine, and understand that they are ultimately responsible for their medications, insurance, and refills. However, those few customers that expect the pharmacy to know everything, including what time they will be arriving from the doctor's office and that they have new insurance. Those customers are the ones who drive the pharmacy staff over the edge.</p>

            <h3>Pharmacy's Favorite Customers</h3>
            <p>Have you informed your pharmacy of your new insurance, and even brought in your new card with you? Have you given them enough time to receive your Rx, process it through the insurance and the reviewing process, fill the Rx, and pass it through the final verification process before you arrive to pick it up? Do you understand that if you have insurance, the pharmacy does not determine the cost of your medication, your insurance does? If so, you're probably a favorite customer!</p>
            <p>A pharmacy's favorite customers are responsible and understand that they aren't the only customers in the area who need a prescription today. They utilize all resources available to them including text/e-mail alerts, web accounts, and the pharmacy's mobile app (if available). The more pleasant your are, the more willing the staff will be to go out of their way to help you. Being pleasant and understanding will make the staff much more likely to offer their help to resolve the issue than if you are screaming and hollering at them.</p>
